<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This dish uses the most tender cut of pork, breaded and fried in a pan with butter</p>
    <p>The breading made with egg and crushed up soda crackers crisps up really nicely when fried. This creates a contrast between the crispy outside, and incredibly tender pork inside. It all comes together to make an unforgettable dish.</p>
