<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Simple, yet delicious. A staple in kitchens all around the world, this combination of simple ingredients comes together to form something truly amazing</p>
    <p>Made by frying two buttered pieces of bread with plenty of cheese between them. The type of bread and cheese used is a topic of great debate, but ultimately, it comes down to personal preference!</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread (thick sliced)</li>
        <li>Butter/Margarine (enough to coat outsides of bread slices)</li>
        <li>Choice of cheese (hard cheeses work best when melted)</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a medium sized pan on the stove (medium heat).</li>
        <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Slice your cheese of choice to desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Place one slice of bread in heated pan, buttered side down.</li>
        <li>Place cheese evenly on top of slice of bread in the pan, and place your other slice of bread on top. (the slices of bread should make a sandwich, with the buttered sides out. This will help them brown up nicely).</li>
        <li>Wait for the cheese to melt just enough to keep the bread slices together, and flip to cook the other side</li>
        <li>Continue to watch and flip, until both sides of the sandwich are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from pan, slice in half, and enjoy!</li>
